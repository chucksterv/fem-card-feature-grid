## My process

This was a fun one to build.

- At small screen sizes, it will stick to one column.
- At medium screen sizes, it will autofit with a minimum with of 21.5em per grid element.
- At larger screen sizes, it will reflect the design file with grid elements given specific content placement.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- SASS

### What I learned

This was a good refresher on CSS Grid and I learned a the difference between auto-fill & auto-fit as well as how the minmax function fits in with these two variables.
